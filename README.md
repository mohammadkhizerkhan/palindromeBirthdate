# palindromeBirthdate
A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards, e.g. madam

This app checks your birthdate in 6 formats dd-mm-yyyy,
mm-dd-yyyy,yyyy-mm-dd,dd-mm-yy,mm-dd-yy,yy-mm-dd. So if your birthdate is 4 Aug 2000, then app will check for 04082000, 08042000, 20000804, 040800,080400,000804.

If any one of the above format is palindrome then it shows the birthdate is palindrome or else it will show how many days you have missed to palindrome date form your birthdate.
